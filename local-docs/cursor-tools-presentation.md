# Proxy Admin Management in Upgradeable Smart Contracts

## Presentation

This repository demonstrates a practical workflow for managing proxy admin ownership in upgradeable smart contracts, specifically focusing on scenarios where you might want to transfer or consolidate admin control. It uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library and Truffle development framework to illustrate these concepts.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to showcase:

- **How to set up and deploy upgradeable ERC20 contracts using proxies.**
- **The importance of ProxyAdmin contracts in managing upgradeable proxies.**
- **A step-by-step workflow to change the admin of a transparent upgradeable proxy.**
- **Verification of state preservation during admin changes.**
- **Visualizing proxy and admin relationships using a diagram.**
- **Highlighting potential misconfigurations and warnings when dealing with proxy admins.**

This project serves as a learning resource and a practical example for developers who need to understand and implement secure and manageable upgradeable smart contracts.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`contracts/`**: Contains Solidity smart contracts.
    - `proxy/`: Contracts related to proxy patterns.
        - `ProxyAdmin.sol`: Wrapper for OpenZeppelin's `ProxyAdmin` contract.
        - `TransaparentUpgradeableProxy.sol`: Wrapper for OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract.

- **`truffle-config.js`**: Truffle configuration file.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Upgradeable Contracts**: The project utilizes upgradeable smart contracts, allowing for future updates to the contract logic without redeploying the proxy address. This is crucial for long-term smart contract management.
- **Transparent Proxies**:  Transparent proxies are used to delegate calls to an implementation contract. They maintain contract state while allowing the underlying logic to be upgraded.
- **ProxyAdmin**: The `ProxyAdmin` contract is a central component for managing transparent proxies. It holds the administrative rights to upgrade proxies and change their admin.
- **Admin Change Workflow**: The core of the project demonstrates a secure workflow to transfer proxy admin control from one `ProxyAdmin` instance to another, ensuring continued upgradability and management under a new admin.
- **State Preservation**: A key aspect of proxy upgrades and admin changes is ensuring that the contract's state (data) remains intact throughout the process. The scripts verify this state preservation.
- **Visualization**: The `dump.js` script and associated scripts provide a visual representation of the proxy-admin relationships, making it easier to understand and audit the contract deployment architecture.

### Main Features

- **Deployment of Upgradeable ERC20 Token**: Deploys an ERC20 token contract using the upgradeable proxy pattern.
- **Proxy Admin Management**: Demonstrates how to deploy and use `ProxyAdmin` contracts to manage proxies.
- **Admin Transfer Workflow**: Implements a script (`complete-test-workflow.js`) that executes a workflow to change the admin of a proxy contract.
- **State Verification**: Includes steps to verify that the contract state (token name, symbol, balances) is preserved after the admin change.
- **Error Scenario Demonstration**: The `erroneous-test-workflow.js` and `run-erroneous.sh` scripts simulate and visualize a common misconfiguration where proxy admins are not correctly managed, leading to potential upgradeability issues.
- **Diagram Generation**: The `dump.js` script generates a Mermaid diagram (`proxy_admin_diagram.mmd`) that visually represents the relationships between proxies, admins, and implementations, aiding in understanding and auditing proxy deployments.
- **Blockchain Analysis Script**: `analyze-blockchain.sh` allows you to analyze existing proxy deployments on a live network by providing proxy addresses and optionally admin addresses.
- **HTML Visualization**: `index.html` provides a simple web interface to render and view the Mermaid diagrams in a browser.

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Running the Complete Test Workflow (Correct Admin Change)

This workflow demonstrates the correct process of changing the proxy admin and verifying state preservation.

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script will:
- Run the `complete-test-workflow.js` script which deploys two ProxyAdmin contracts, two proxies, and an ERC20 implementation.
- It then changes the admin of the first proxy from the first ProxyAdmin to the second ProxyAdmin.
- Finally, it verifies the state and generates `run_output.txt` with the script's output and `proxy_admin_diagram.mmd` with the visualization.

#### 2. Running the Erroneous Test Workflow (Incorrect Admin Configuration)

This workflow demonstrates a scenario where the admin is *not* changed, leading to a misconfiguration that can be visualized.

```bash
./run-erroneous.sh
```

This script will:
- Run the `erroneous-test-workflow.js` script, similar to the complete workflow but skips the admin change step.
- It generates `erroneous_output.txt` and `proxy_admin_diagram.mmd` to visualize the erroneous admin configuration.

#### 3. Analyzing Proxy Relationships on a Blockchain

To analyze proxy contracts on an existing blockchain (e.g., a testnet or mainnet), use the `analyze-blockchain.sh` script.

```bash
./analyze-blockchain.sh <network> <proxy_address_1> <proxy_address_2> ... [--admin <admin_address>]
```

For example, to analyze two proxy contracts `0xProxy1Address` and `0xProxy2Address` on the `development` network, with a known admin address `0xAdminAddress`:

```bash
./analyze-blockchain.sh development 0xProxy1Address 0xProxy2Address --admin 0xAdminAddress
```

If you don't provide admin addresses, the script will attempt to infer them from OpenZeppelin deployment files if available in the `.openzeppelin` directory, or analyze based on on-chain data.

#### 4. Viewing the Diagram

After running either `run.sh` or `run-erroneous.sh` (or `analyze-blockchain.sh`), open `index.html` in your browser.

- Copy the content of `proxy_admin_diagram.mmd` and paste it into the text area in `index.html`.
- Click "Render Diagram" to visualize the proxy admin relationships.

Alternatively, you can directly open `proxy_admin_diagram.mmd` in an online Mermaid editor like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live).

### Script Descriptions

- **`complete-test-workflow.js`**:
    - Deploys an initial ProxyAdmin and a proxy contract managed by it.
    - Deploys a second ProxyAdmin.
    - Simulates importing the initial deployment under the context of the second ProxyAdmin, showcasing the warning about admin mismatch.
    - Changes the admin of the first proxy to the second ProxyAdmin using the first ProxyAdmin.
    - Verifies that state is preserved and that the second ProxyAdmin can now manage the first proxy.

- **`erroneous-test-workflow.js`**:
    - Similar to `complete-test-workflow.js`, but it intentionally skips the step of changing the proxy admin.
    - This demonstrates a scenario where the intended admin (second ProxyAdmin) does not actually control the first proxy, leading to a potentially problematic configuration.
    - Useful for understanding the importance of correctly updating proxy admin ownership.

- **`dump.js`**:
    - Analyzes deployed proxy contracts on a given network.
    - Reads proxy and admin addresses (either from command-line arguments, `.openzeppelin` files, or default values in the script).
    - Queries blockchain storage slots to determine the admin and implementation addresses for each proxy.
    - Generates a Mermaid diagram (`proxy_admin_diagram.mmd`) visualizing the relationships between proxies, admin contracts, and implementation contracts.
    - Provides a summary of the analysis, including the number of proxies, admins, and implementations found.

- **`analyze-blockchain.sh`**:
    - A shell script that simplifies running `dump.js` for analyzing proxies on a specified network.
    - Takes network name and proxy addresses as command-line arguments.
    - Optionally accepts admin addresses via the `--admin` flag.
    - Executes `dump.js` with the provided parameters and network.
    - Suggests viewing the generated diagram online or using Mermaid CLI to create a PNG image.

### Interpreting the Diagram

The Mermaid diagram generated by `dump.js` visually represents the proxy admin setup:

- **Admin Nodes**: Represent `ProxyAdmin` contracts.
    - Color-coded to distinguish different admin contracts.
    - Labeled with the admin address and whether it's considered a "Correct Admin" or "Erroneous Admin" based on configuration.
    - "Correct Admin" and "Main Admin" are styled with dashed borders to highlight them.
- **Proxy Nodes**: Represent `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contracts.
    - Connected to their respective admin contracts with directed arrows.
    - Labeled with the proxy address and type (e.g., "ERC20 Proxy").
    - Proxies with mismatched admins (as detected by OpenZeppelin's expected configuration) are styled differently (orange fill, dashed border) to highlight potential issues.
- **Implementation Nodes**: Represent the implementation contracts (e.g., `ERC20_V1`).
    - Proxies are connected to their implementations with dashed lines, indicating the delegation relationship.
- **Legend**: Explains the color coding and styling used in the diagram for different types of contracts and relationships.

By examining the diagram, you can quickly understand:
- Which admin contract manages which proxy contracts.
- If there are any proxies with unexpected or "erroneous" admin relationships (mismatches between expected and actual admins).
- The overall structure of your upgradeable contract deployment.
